# News Web Site
It's a news site with just JavaScript and bootstrap

- News aggregator from around the world, with categories, search engine and for without backend. This application aims to show how simple it can consume APIs found freely(not totally ðŸ˜…) on the internet if applied to fun projects.

- Minimally optimized for mobile.
- It's a learning application, **don't use it in production**.
